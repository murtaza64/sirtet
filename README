# Sir Tet AI Playground (and a few agents)

This will run on any terminal with curses support.

To run it, from the `sirtet` directory run `make play` or
```
python3 main.py 2> stderr.out
```

If it crashes as soon as you start it, your terminal is probably too small--please try making the window bigger and running again.

To install agents, modify `AIRunner.installed_agents` in `ai_runner.py`.
